                <p class="item-name">Chicken</p>
                <p>Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world.[1] Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising
                chickens—in comparison to mammals such as cattle or hogs—chicken meat (commonly called just "chicken") and chicken eggs
                have become prevalent in numerous cuisines.
                
                Chicken can be prepared in a vast range of ways, including baking, grilling, barbecuing, frying, and boiling. Since the
                latter half of the 20th century, prepared chicken has become a staple of fast food. Chicken is sometimes cited as being
                more healthful than red meat, with lower concentrations of cholesterol and saturated fat.[2]
                
                The poultry farming industry that accounts for chicken production takes on a range of forms across different parts of
                the world. In developed countries, chickens are typically subject to intensive farming methods while less-developed
                areas raise chickens using more traditional farming techniques. The United Nations estimates there to be 19 billion
                chickens on Earth today, making them outnumber humans more than two to one
